IconCaptcha is a faster and more user-friendly captcha than most other captchas. You no longer have to read any annoying 
text-images, with IconCaptcha you only have to compare two images and select the image which is only present once.

This repository contains the front-end source of the IconCaptcha plugins for PHP and ASP.NET. For the installation guide of this package, follow the installation guide of the respective back-end package you want to use.
